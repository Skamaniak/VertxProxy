# VertxProxy
Simple HTTP and SSL Vertx Proxy

##Project goals
I want to develop thin, light-weight proxy that is able to proxy SSL and HTTP traffic using [Vert.x](http://vertx.io/).

##Basic features
- proxying HTTP requests and responses
- Creating tunnels on behalf of connect requests from clients
- Supporting more proxies in a row (proxy chaining)
