# VertxProxy
Simple HTTP and SSL Vertx Proxy

##Project goals
I want to develop thin, light-weight proxy that is able to proxy SSL and HTTP traffic using [Vert.x](http://vertx.io/).

##Basic features
- Proxying HTTP requests and responses
- Creating tunnels on behalf of connect requests from clients
- Supporting more proxies in a row (proxy chaining)

##Planned features / components 
- Tests
- Adding custom headers to requests and responses
 
##Possible features (nice to have)
- Traffic analysis and serialization (image, video, files recognition and serialization to disk)
- SSL traffic decoding

##Documentation
TBD

##Run in IDE
